                <h1>Manifesto for Team Open: A Call for Decentralized Social Protocols</h1>
            
                <h3>1. Preamble</h3>
                <p>In the spirit of the open web, the decentralization, the extensible web, and principles that uphold human agency, accessibility, interoperability, and ecological sustainability, we call upon all stakeholders to join us in the commitment to move social media and social software from centralized, walled gardens to open protocols.</p>
            
                <h3>2. The Era of Open Protocols</h3>
                <p>We envision an era of open protocols, where the digital infrastructure evolves organically and inclusively, built and nurtured by those who care deeply about the communities they serve. It is an era where we are not divided by proprietary interests or insular perspectives, but interconnected through mutual learning and shared growth.</p>
            
                <h3>3. The Challenge of Closed Systems</h3>
                <p>Today, we face a challenge, a challenge of closed systems, controlled by centralized authorities where users lack agency and autonomy. These systems, such as Meta, Twitter, TikTok, T2, Tribel, Instagram's Twitter clone, and others, reduce the web's infinite potential to a controlled, restricted experience.</p>
            
                <h3>4. The Promise of Decentralization</h3>
                <p>Decentralization promises us a different path. It offers a way to ensure that control over data, over interactions, and over the web itself is handed back to the users. It allows for a more democratic and equitable web, where the power and the potential are shared among all participants.</p>
            
                <h3>5. The Importance of Interoperability</h3>
                <p>Interoperability is the bridge that connects us. It allows diverse systems to work in harmony, fostering innovation while ensuring that no single entity can control or monopolize the web. We should champion these interoperable systems, advocating for standards that enable communication and cooperation across platforms.</p>
            
                <h3>6. The Power of Community</h3>
                <p>Communities are the heart of the web. They are the spaces where individuals come together to share, learn, create, and grow. In an open, decentralized web, communities can thrive, free from the constraints of centralized control. We must prioritize the needs of these communities, fostering spaces that are safe, inclusive, and empowering.</p>
            
                <h3>7. The Need for Unity</h3>
                <p>In this effort, we must remember that we are on the same side. We may have different perspectives, different approaches, but our goals align. We must not allow our differences to divide us, but instead let them inspire us, pushing us to create a web that is truly representative of all its users.</p>
            
                <h3>8. A Protocol Commons: A Shared Vision</h3>
                <p>As we build these open systems, we are creating a new form of digital commons, a space that is not owned by an individual, a state, or a corporation. Instead, it is held collectively, shared by all who participate in it. This concept of the commons is not new; it has its roots in centuries of communal stewardship of shared resources.</p>
            
                <h4>The Digital Commons:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Clearly Defined Boundaries:</strong> An effective commons requires clear boundaries. Who has access to the resource and under what conditions?For our digital commons, this could mean defining who can contribute to and benefit from the open protocols.</li>

                    <li><strong>Proportional Equivalence between Benefits and Costs:</strong> Ostrom's principles call for rules ensuring that those who contribute more to the commons receive greater benefits. In our context, this could translate into recognition, influence, or other forms of reward for those who contribute significantly to the development and maintenance of open protocols.</li>

                    <li><strong>Collective Decision Making:</strong> Decisions regarding the commons should be made collectively, with those who use and maintain the resource having a say in setting its rules. For the open web, this suggests a collaborative approach to designing and implementing standards and protocols.</li>
            
                    <li><strong>Monitoring and Sanctions:</strong> Effective commons have systems for monitoring use and imposing sanctions for misuse. In the digital world, this could involve mechanisms for detecting and mitigating abusive behavior, spamming, or other harmful actions.</li>
            
                    <li><strong>Conflict Resolution Mechanisms:</strong> Conflicts are inevitable in any shared resource system. Having efficient, transparent, and accessible mechanisms for resolving disputes is critical to maintaining the health of the digital commons.</li>
            
                    <li><strong>Nested Layers:</strong> Finally, Ostrom suggested that larger commons are made up of smaller, nested layers. This could be interpreted in our context as encouraging a variety of open protocols and platforms, each serving specific communities or purposes, but interoperating and contributing to the broader digital commons.</li>
                </ol>
            
                <p>The principles of the commons guide us towards a collaborative, equitable approach to building the open web. In embracing these principles, we move away from a web dominated by a handful of powerful entities, and towards a web that truly belongs to us all. Together, we can build a digital commons that serves humanity, respects individual agency, and champions open, collaborative innovation.</p>
            
                <h3>9. Conclusion</h3>
                <p>Join us in creating a future where the internet is open, accessible, and truly global. Let's ensure that the internet remains a force for good, a space for creativity, knowledge, and connection, free from the constraints of centralized control. Join Team Open. Together, we can redefine the future.</p>

                <p>The IETF gave us the internet standards we use to day and their aphormism is as true today as it was when Dave Clark first said it 1992:</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>

                    We reject: kings, presidents and voting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    We believe in: rough consensus and running code</p>
                </blockquote>
